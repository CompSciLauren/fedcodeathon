## How It Works
1. Users will first input: A potential business-location (e.g. city, county), a business-type (e.g. restaurant, antique shop), and a radius within the business-location.

2. Our software will then display a map with checkpoints representing competing businesses within the chosen radius, traffic data such as walk, bike, and transit data. This will give entrepreneurs a brief insight regarding the chosen location.

3. We will then compile all of this information into a one-page report which will give the entrepreneur a detailed insight regarding the chosen location.
