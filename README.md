Starting a business can be stressful. One of the biggest challenges entrepreneurs all around the world are facing is choosing the perfect location to start their next business. Our team here at ValleyFind have designed an innovative one-stop solution to help entrepreneurs tackle this problem.

Our state-of-the-art technology provides entrepreneurs with the latest, most insightful data given a specific location to help them optimize their search for the perfect location to start their next venture. 

## This version of ValleyFind includes:

## How It Works
1. Users will first input: A potential business-location (e.g. city, county), a business-type (e.g. restaurant, antique shop), and a radius within the business-location.
2. Our software will then display a map with checkpoints representing competing businesses, traffic data, average real-estate price, and air quality data. This will give entrepreneurs a brief insight regarding the chosen location.
3. We will then compile all of this information into a one-page report which will give the entrepreneur a detailed insight regarding the chosen location. 
4. Entrepreneurs will finally be able to generate reports of multiple other locations and compare them to decide on the perfect location to start their next business.
